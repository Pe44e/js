# Fetch a Single User

From the backend, you are able to get the details of any user within your in app or ecosystem wallet.

To get the user details, you can make a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

```
https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/user-details
```

### Query Parameters

You can specify the query parameter `queryBy` to query by different user identifiers:

- `queryBy`: The parameter to query by. Can be one of `walletAddress`, `email`, `phone`, `externalWalletAddress`, or `id`.

You can then specify the value to query by, matching the queryBy parameter:

- `walletAddress`: The user's wallet address that thirdweb has generated for them
- `email`: The user's email address
- `phone`: The user's phone number
- `externalWalletAddress`: The user's wallet address that used to login via SIWE
- `id`: The user's ID (for custom auth)

### Authentication

You need to include your ThirdWeb Client Secret in the Authorization header.

If you are an ecosystem owner, you have to include the `x-ecosystem-id` header and optionally the `x-ecosystem-partner-id` header if the ecosystem is set to partners only.

### Example curl Command

Here's an example curl command to fetch user details by email:

```bash

curl -X GET 'https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/user-details?queryBy=email&email=user@example.com' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY'

```

Here's an example curl command to fetch user details by address:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/user-details?queryBy=walletAddress&walletAddress=0x123456789abcdef' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
```

Here's an example curl command to fetch the user details for an ecosystem owner:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/user-details?queryBy=walletAddress&walletAddress=0x123456789abcdef' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-id: ecosystem.YOUR_ECOSYSTEM_ID' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-partner-id: YOUR_PARTNER_ID'
```

In both examples, replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual ThirdWeb Client Secret.

Replace `YOUR_ECOSYSTEM_ID` and `YOUR_PARTNER_ID` with your actual ecosystem ID and partner ID respectively. The partner ID can be one you set up for yourself as the ecosystem owner.

### Response Format

The API returns a JSON array with the following structure for each user:

```json
[
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "walletAddress": "string",
    "email": "string (optional)",
    "phone": "string (optional)",
    "createdAt": "string",
    "linkedAccounts": [
      {
        "type": "string",
        "details": {
          "phone": "string",
          // or
          "email": "string",
          // or
          "address": "string",
          // or
          "id": "string",
          // Additional key-value pairs may be present
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note: The `details` object in `linkedAccounts` will contain different fields based on the account type. See the [list of Strategies](#list-of-strategies) above for more information.

Remember to handle the response appropriately in your chosen programming language, including error cases and parsing the JSON response.

### Convenience Methods

If you are using the thirdweb SDK, you can use the `getUser` method to retrieve user details.

<Stack>
 <ArticleIconCard
	title="getUser"
	icon={TypeScriptIcon}
	description="Get user details from your backend for thirdweb wallets in TypeScript"
	href="/references/typescript/v5/getUser"
/>
</Stack>

# Fetch All Users

Once you have users connecting to your app through in-app wallets, you can fetch all users through our REST API:
```
https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/v1/users
```

## Headers

You need to include the following headers:

- `Content-Type`: Must be set to `application/json`
- `x-secret-key`: Your secret key for authentication
- `x-ecosystem-id` (optional): Your ecosystem ID
- `x-ecosystem-partner-id` (optional): Your ecosystem partner ID

## Example curl Command

Here's an example curl command to pregenerate a thirdweb wallet for the user `user@example.com`:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/v1/users?offset=200&limit=100' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Limit defaults to 100 users per request.

<Callout variant='info' title='Getting ecosystem users'>
For ecosystem wallets, the secret key have to be from the same account as the ecosystem owner.
</Callout>
