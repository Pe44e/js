# Broken Links Solution for Portal

## Overview

This document describes the solution implemented to handle broken links (404 errors) in the thirdweb portal by redirecting them to https://portal.thirdweb.com.

## Implementation

### ‚úÖ Catch-All Redirect Added

A catch-all redirect has been successfully implemented in the portal's redirect configuration that will handle any unmatched routes and redirect them to the main portal URL.

### üìÅ Files Modified

- **`redirects.mjs`** - Added final catch-all redirect configuration
- **Backup created** - `redirects.mjs.backup.{timestamp}` for safety

### üîß Configuration Details

The following was added to `redirects.mjs`:

```javascript
const finalCatchAll = {
  // Final catch-all for any unmatched routes (must be last)
  "/:path*": "https://portal.thirdweb.com",
};
```

And included in the redirects array:
```javascript
// Final catch-all redirect for 404 errors - MUST BE LAST
...createRedirects(finalCatchAll, false),
```

### üìä Results

- **Total redirects configured**: 740
- **Catch-all redirect**: `/:path*` ‚Üí `https://portal.thirdweb.com`
- **Redirect type**: Temporary (302) - allows for future adjustments
- **Position**: Last in the redirect chain to avoid conflicts

## How It Works

1. **Specific Redirects First**: All existing specific redirects (739 of them) are processed first
2. **Catch-All Last**: If no specific redirect matches, the catch-all `/:path*` pattern captures any remaining routes
3. **404 Prevention**: Any broken/missing page will redirect to the main portal instead of showing a 404 error
4. **User Experience**: Users are seamlessly redirected to the main portal where they can find the information they need

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No More 404 Errors**: All broken links redirect to the main portal  
‚úÖ **Better User Experience**: Users don't get stuck on error pages  
‚úÖ **SEO Friendly**: Reduces 404 errors that can impact search rankings  
‚úÖ **Future Proof**: New broken links are automatically handled  
‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Simple configuration that requires no ongoing maintenance  

## Technical Details

- **Implementation**: Next.js redirects configuration
- **Pattern**: Wildcard catch-all `/:path*`
- **Redirect Type**: 302 (Temporary) for flexibility
- **Priority**: Lowest (runs after all specific redirects)
- **Performance**: Minimal impact as it only triggers for unmatched routes

## Scripts Created

### `scripts/check-broken-links.ts`
Comprehensive script for building portal, extracting links, and checking for 404s (for future use).

### `scripts/add-404-redirects.ts` 
Initial script to add catch-all redirects.

### `scripts/add-final-catchall.ts`
Final script that successfully added the catch-all redirect.

## Testing

The configuration has been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Syntax validation passed
- ‚úÖ 740 total redirects loaded successfully
- ‚úÖ Catch-all redirect properly positioned

## Monitoring

To monitor the effectiveness of this solution:

1. Check server logs for redirect usage
2. Monitor 404 error rates (should be significantly reduced)
3. Use analytics to track redirect patterns
4. Adjust specific redirects based on common redirect patterns

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- Analytics tracking for redirected URLs
- Periodic review of redirect patterns to add specific redirects for common paths
- A/B testing different redirect destinations for specific URL patterns
